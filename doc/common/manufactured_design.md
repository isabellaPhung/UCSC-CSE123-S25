The triangular volume on the back of the device serves as a kickstand and where some of the PCB modules are located. In addition, the trangular kickstand keeps center of gravity low, making it difficult to tip over. This space is also necessary to fit two 3500mAh 18650 battery cells which we selected over a specific pouch battery for repairability and it provides room for easily assembly and disassembly.
The screen of the device is tilted at comfortable viewing angle and includes two slits for the speakers, as well as a power button and the 7.5 inch LCD touchscreen.
