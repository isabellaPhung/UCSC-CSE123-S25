People need to keep track of time. Its our most essential resource as living beings. Organizing ones time is key to making the best use of it. One approach to addressing this need is developing techonology that aims to provide support in scheduling or hindering agents that waste time. Software that discourgaes or prevents extended use of entertainmenmt applications addresses an important aspect of time loss but does not take into account time wasted outside of its respective device and it does provide support in planning for effective use of time. There is a market a digital planner or calender device that addresses the scheduler aspect. These devices often contain large LCD displays, compatibility with calener applications such as google calender, and incoorporate a minimalsitic design. Furthermore though these devices contain apps that can be installed on smart devices they most importantly are a seperate device that do not contain the ability to run other software. We aimed to design a dynamic schedeuling companion building on the strong foundation in the current market. Static calenders do not address a key issue with abiding to a calender. Sometimes life happens and things come up that make it difficult or impossible to abide by the calender. Our device addresses this issue by defining these occurances and implementing a system that allows the user to address them and factor them into the planner in real time. This device will also be more focused on fulfilling immediate tasks implenting methods such as pamadoro to make the device more interactive and present. We've also discussed functionality that discourages excessuive time spent on device entertainment using a notification system and the cloud.
