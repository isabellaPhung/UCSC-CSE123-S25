Time is an essential resource, and managing it throughout work and life is a constant balancing act. We aim to assist in sorting out these constant considerations and burdens through a system to organize time. Our approach utilizes technology that aims to provide support in time management or in hindering agents that waste time. Software that helps people adhere to their goals and promises, yet divorced from the busy screens that so easily distract us. A separate device, compatible with familiar scheduling services such as Google Calendar, yet capable of dynamically constructing a workflow for our user to follow. Static calendars do not address a key issue with abiding to a calendar: life is far too complicated to parse out into chunks without issue; interruptions and errors will always be present. Our device addresses this issue by fulfilling real time compensation from sudden interruptions to missed days of activity. Our separate device should always be present, reminding and encouraging the user to fulfill their goals and finding time to occupy with events they enjoy without worry.
