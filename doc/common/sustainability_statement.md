In designing this device, we wanted to create a sustainable product.
Our device will be built using recyclable materials for its casing and internal structure, and we will work with suppliers who adhere to environmental and social governance (ESG) standards.
We will also use sustainable packaging materials such as vegetable inks for printing, recycled cardboard, and bio-based plastic films.
We are commited to minimizing the environmental impacts involved with the creation, usage, and disposal of our device.
