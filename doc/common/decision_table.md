# Device Criteria

Our solution included the following criteria tackling the questions:
- **Budget:** How expensive would the device be to produce?
- **Presence:** How often will our user acknowledge the device during their work period?
- **Ease of Use:** How coinvent is it to interface with the device?
- **Barrier of Entry:** How much will the user be forced to learn in order to properly use the device?
- **Sustainability:** Is the device created from sustainable materials?
- **Privacy:** Is the user's data being safely managed? Is the data collected sensitive?

These topics were distributed into a weighting system such that our designs can be properly scored, which can be seen in the table below:

| Criteria         | Weight |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Budget           | 20     |
| Presence         | 20     |
| Ease of Use      | 20     |
| Barrier of Entry | 20     |
| Sustainability   | 10     |
| Privacy          | 10     |

# Brainstorming

# Conclusion

Both the tablet planner and game style device appear to be the most ideal for the considerations given.
A combination of the two was chosen in the end, a sizeable desktop device with a large and present screen as was suggested from the tablet planner, yet with the addition of several interfacing buttons for clear interfacing.
