1. Presence: the user wants to be reminded of it, but not too much such that they are distracted by it.
2. Portability/ease of set up: the device will be portable, providing an alternative way to view your schedule without relying on your phone. The device although offline when on the go, should still display data from when it was last connected to the internet
3. Configurable: customizable for the user's habits and workflow. With integration from existing digital calendar and productivity tools such as Google Calendar.
4. Accessible: Schedule and settings are visible and configurable on the go, without the need for the device. Also allowing for the data backup if the device is broken.
