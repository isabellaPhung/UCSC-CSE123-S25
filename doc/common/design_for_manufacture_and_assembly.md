1. DFM Emphasis:
Minimize part count, ensure ease of assembly, and use sustainable, readily sourced materials that adhere to ESG standards.

2. Component and Part Optimization
Simplified System Architecture:
Use a low‑power SoC that provides enough performance for basic apps without unnecessary complexity.
Limit the number of integrated peripherals to only those essential for Wi‑Fi connectivity, Bluetooth, and basic I/O.
Minimization of Part Count:
Integrate functions wherever possible to reduce separate components.
Use a unified PCB design that consolidates sensor circuits, display driver circuitry, and memory modules to simplify assembly.

3. Material and Process Selection
External Casing:
Use a blend of recycled polymers and bio‑based sugarcane materials sourced from suppliers in Malaysia/Indonesia that meet ISO 14021 standards.
Ensure the casing is designed with minimal thickness while maintaining durability.
Internal Structure:
Use recycled aluminum for internal structural supports, taking advantage of its low‑energy reprocessing.
Display Options:
Provide two models: an LCD variant and an E‑Ink variant for users who prioritize energy efficiency and long life cycles.
Design the display mounting system to be common across models, with slight adjustments for backplane electronics.

4. Assembly and Integration
Ease of Assembly:
Design the device with self‑orienting parts and clearly marked alignment features to facilitate automated or manual assembly.
Use snap‑fit connections and standardized fasteners that reduce the need for adhesives or complex bonding.
Modular Design:
Develop modules for the display, battery, and main logic board that can be independently assembled and later integrated.
Allow for easy disassembly to facilitate repair or recycling.
Interconnects and Tolerances:
Define clear tolerances for PCB components, connectors, and display interfaces to minimize assembly errors.
Include “keyed” connectors to prevent misalignment during the integration of sensors, memory, and driver circuits.

5. Process Considerations and Supplier Collaboration
Manufacturing Process:
Choose manufacturing techniques that are optimized for high‑volume, low‑cost production.
Specify processes with low energy consumption and minimal waste.
Supplier Standards:

6. Quality Assurance and Testing
Design for Testability:
Integrate test points on the PCB for automated functional checks during assembly.
Ensure that all critical interfaces are accessible for in‑process quality assurance.
Tolerance Verification:
Create detailed CAD drawings with precise dimensions and tolerance specifications to be shared with suppliers and manufacturing partners.
Implement in‑line inspection procedures to verify material quality and assembly integrity.
7. Sustainability and End-of-Life
Recyclability:
Design the product for ease of disassembly, marking components clearly for recycling.
Use materials such as recycled polymers, bio‑based plastics, recycled aluminum that have established recycling processes.
