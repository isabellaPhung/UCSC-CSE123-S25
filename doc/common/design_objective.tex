\begin{enumerate}
\item Firstly the device should have presence, the user wants to be reminded of it, but not too much such that they are distracted by it. This should have some kind of middle ground.
\item Visibility; The device needs to be visible and accessable, this is a measure of its interactiveness.
\item Portability/ease of set up; Whether the device is meant portable or not, being able to move it without resetting the system (the one that the user has to spent a lot of time on).
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item This means stuff like applying a CMOS battery for offline time keeping or having non-volatile storage. As well as making sure the device isn't annoyingly bulky (such as a massive power supply) or requires an annoying set up sequence.
      \item Make sure the device works without internet *always*, there's nothing more annoying that a productivity tool that only works sometimes.
    \end{enumerate}
