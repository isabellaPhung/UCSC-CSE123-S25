The development process of both our device and prototype was deeply insightful. We experienced the entire process from identifying a need, designing a solution, and actualizing a prototype. Our team worked incredibly well together in all the processes of the project. We spent the appropriate amount of time brainstorming, planning, and coordinating. We delegated the different sections of the prototype for streamlined completion. Although we had specialized roles, there was a significant amount of overlap in our work between the front and backends. Our planning could have used a little refinement, as we may have potentially avoided the memory bottleneck with a bit more brainstorming early in our prototype. We completed parts of the prototype in parallel, and this was instrumental in completing the prototype by the deadline. We were also able to recognize the adjustments that we'd need to make for the device, as it was fairly apparent and straightforward, but the prototype itself is fairly detailed relative to the device. The only real adjustments outside of refining our research would be meeting more often, as this would have made us more resilient throughout the design process. I primarily focused on the front end, and I know there were many refinements, such as making habits to read and write from the web side. Though the task specialization was beneficial to the process, I know working on the backend would've provided insight for a more robust implementation that would've more closely resembled our device.
