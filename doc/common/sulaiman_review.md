The development process of both our device and prototype was a deeply insightful. We experienced the entire process from identifying a need, designing a soluion and actualizing a prototype. Our team worked incredobly well together in all the processes of the project. We spent the appropriate amount of time brainstorming, planning and coordinating. We delegated the different sections of the prototype for a streamlined completion. Though we had specialized roles there was a good amount of overlap in our work within the front and backends. Our planning could've used a little refinement as we may have potentially avoided the memory bottleneck with a little more brainstorming early into our prototype. We completed parts of the prototype in parallel and this was instrumental in completing the prototype by the deadline. We were also able to recognize the adjusments that we'd need to make for the device as it was fairly apparent and straight forward but the prototype itself is fairly detailed relative to the device. The only real adjusments outside of refining our research would be meeting more often as this would have made of more resilent throughout the design process.
