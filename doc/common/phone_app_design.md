## Phone app
The phone app closely mirrors the web app and productivity device in terms of functionality and design. The app will require the user to sign in and just like with the web app, they can add a new device or select a device to view the dashboard of.
The most important element being that it includes bluetooth functionality for wifi provisioning.
