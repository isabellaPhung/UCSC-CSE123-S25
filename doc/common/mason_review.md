The development of our prototype demonstrated strong capabilities despite the limited resources available on the ESP32-C3. We were able to implement the most critical aspect of our design: managing user entries relevant to daily planning. This core functionality was successfully realized, validating the feasibility of our design concept. However, in hindsight, I wish we had been able to integrate more of our planned features, particularly the time blocking system, which our hardware ultimately could not support. We spent a substantial amount of time refactoring instead of focusing on providing a functional and fluid system one would want on a device designed to motivate and remind. One major lesson learned was the importance of benchmarking early to ensure we are choosing a suitable platform for our prototype, instead of one that we had found to be the most available. Had we thoroughly evaluated the performance limitations of the ESP32-C3 beforehand, we might have opted for a more powerful platform like the Raspberry Pi series of processors during the prototyping phase. This would have allowed us to fully test and iterate on our feature-rich design, and only then select a device more appropriate for our final use case. Instead, we found ourselves constrained by the hardware, forced to cut back on functionality to fit within its limitations.
