# Why are we making this Device?

One of the most relevant topics to humanity is productivity. Higher productivity scales with any subject's success whether it's an individual or a society. Within the current market in first world countries media has become highly monetized. Our attention has become a product to many companies. This is one of many factors that makes it difficult for people to organize and prioritize their daily activities. Productivity is reliant on our ability to prioritize and organize our time and thus there is a demand for products that assist with this process. Scheduling applications are an effective medium to address the issue however while they may address organization they do little to differentiate different activities thus making it difficult to prioritize. We identified the parameters of differentiation that would address activity priority and these were necessity, urgency, and frequency. We designed the application on the basis of these parameters.
