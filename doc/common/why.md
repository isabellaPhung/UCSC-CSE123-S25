# Why are we making this Device?

Productivity is a key factor in the success of both individuals and societies. In todayâ€™s market, where media companies monetize our attention, staying focused and organized while prioritizing tasks can be challenging. Although scheduling applications help with organization, they often treat all tasks the same, making it hard to determine priorities and decide on which activity to work on and when. To address this, we identified the parameters of differentiation that would address activity priority and these were necessity, urgency, and frequency. Our application is designed around these criteria to help users prioritize more effectively.
