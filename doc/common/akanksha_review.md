## Akanksha
Considering our hardware limitations, we were able to successfully demonstrate most of the features that we set out to implement. We were able to get most of the core functionality working, but it would be nice to have a device which could handle more features. Something we did well in this project was delegating tasks effectively. We all worked on different aspects of the device, and were able to work in parallel on the backend and frontend. Something that could have helped our project go smoother is more extensive planning, probably starting from the first quarter. Because we didnâ€™t go into the second quarter with a solid plan and idea of who would be working on what, it took us a few weeks to find our footing. If we started with a better plan, we might have been able to discover the memory issues earlier and make some hardware changes. Additionally, there were a few times where we had to make changes to the web app, resulting in having to refactor the Python server code. Sometimes this was trivial, but in other cases it took a while to figure out how to modify the code such that the web app to server and server to database communication would still work correctly. If we had fleshed out the details of our design a bit more, we might have been able to avoid this and have time to implement more features.
