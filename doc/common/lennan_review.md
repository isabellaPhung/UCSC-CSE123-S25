The git environment worked well for managing tasks, as well as collaboration on
the documentation.
The firmware components had less collaboration, as they were separated by
function, which needed less collaboration until bringing everything together.
Each could be developed and tested individually, but that ended up causing
problems with memory availability when all put together.
I've never been in a situation when the program hit a memory limit, so I hadn't
thought of keeping track of the memory usage of each component.
I think the AWS side of the development was fine.
Maybe I could have configured the account access control earlier, so that
everyone had access from the start.
