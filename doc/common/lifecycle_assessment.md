Energy Goals TODO
- in production
- in use

The case for the device will follow common designs in the market and use plastics and metals for construction.
In order to reduce negative impact on the environment, the device will use a biodegradable corn-based plastic as well as recycled aluminium.
Majority of the casing materials will come from environmentally concious sources. 
Unfortunately we don't have a say in the materials used for the other components of the device.

In order to satisfy the portability requirement, the device will need a rechargeable battery as the power source.
Compared to sourcing a brand new battery, recycled batteries consume less energy, water, and produce less emissions in their production. 

**High Performance Electronics:**

Objects:  

Semiconductor Chips, Memory Modules, Sensors, Display Driver Circuitry, Backplane Electronics

Sourcing:

Generally Sourced from Semiconductor Fabs in Taiwan, South Korea, or China.

Sustainability:

Material extraction is correlated with high carbon emissions. Manufacturing requires high energy expenditure. Recycling is difficult and often costs a lot of money. We will work with suppliers who adhere to environmental and social governance (ESG) standards.

**Device Display:**

Objects:

LCD Variant or E-Ink Variant will be supported as different models of the same product.

Sourcing:

LCD model panels are generally sourced in South Korea, Japan, or China. They are generally regulated to optimize for production energy efficiency and reduction of waste. 

E-Inks are generally sourced from Taiwan from companies such as E-Ink Holdings. These suppliers generally also focus on sustainability. 

Sustainability:

LCDs have established separation streams that make for easier recycling. E-Ink panels are easier to recycle and have significantly longer life spans relative to LCDs. Both are significantly more energy-efficient and sustainable than OLED displays.

**Device External Structure:**

Objects:

A blend of recycled polymers and bio-based sugarcane renewable source

Sourcing:

They are generally sourced from Malaysia and Indonesia, which specialize in recycled plastics and exercise  ISO 14021 audits and similar standards to verify their recycled content and eco-friendly production processes.

Sustainability:

The plastic blend would require less energy and is engineered for easier recyclability.

**Device Internal Structure:**

Objects:

Recycled Aluminum

Sourcing:

Generally sourced from certified European or American Recycling plants.

Sustainability:

Reprocessing recycled Aluminum requires about 5% of the energy expenditure of newly processed Aluminum. This process lowers embodied carbon as well

**Prints On Packaging and Printed Materials:** 

Objects:

Vegetable non-VOC Inks: These Inks are made from renewable sources and contain minimal volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations.

Sourcing:

These are generally sourced from eco-friendly chemical suppliers in Europe. 

Sustainability:

Production requires fewer emissions and toxic waste and is easier to recycle. 

\


**Packaging:**

Objects:

FSC-Certified Recycled Cardboard(Forest Stewardship Council) and Minimal Bio-Based Plastic Films.

The Films are used for shrink wrapping in packaging.

Sourcing:

FSC-certified recycled Cardboard comes from European suppliers, and The Bio-Based Films are generally sourced from South East Asia, generally from Indonesia and Malaysia. 

\


Sustainability:

FSC-certified recycled Cardboard boasts a lower carbon footprint. Both require less energy expenditure and are easily recycled.
