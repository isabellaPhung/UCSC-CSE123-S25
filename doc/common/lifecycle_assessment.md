Energy Goals TODO
- in production
- in use

The case for the device will follow common designs in the market and use plastics and metals for construction.
In order to reduce negative impact on the environment, the device will use a biodegradable corn-based plastic as well as recycled aluminium.
Majority of the casing materials will come from environmentally concious sources. 
Unfortunately we don't have a say in the materials used for the other components of the device.

In order to satisfy the portability requirement, the device will need a rechargeable battery as the power source.
Compared to sourcing a brand new battery, recycled batteries consume less energy, water, and produce less emissions in their production.
