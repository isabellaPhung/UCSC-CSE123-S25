### High Performance Electronics {.unnumbered .unlisted}

- **Objects**: Semiconductor Chips, Memory Modules, Sensors, Display Driver Circuitry, Backplane Electronics

- **Sourcing**: Generally Sourced from Semiconductor Fabs in Taiwan, South Korea, or China.

- **Sustainability**: Material extraction is correlated with high carbon emissions.
  Manufacturing requires high energy expenditure.
  Recycling is difficult and often costs a lot of money.
  We will work with suppliers who adhere to environmental and social governance (ESG) standards.

### Device Display {.unnumbered .unlisted}

- **Objects**: LCD Variant or E-Ink Variant will be supported as different models of the same product.

- **Sourcing**: LCD model panels are generally sourced in South Korea, Japan, or China.
  They are generally regulated to optimize for production energy efficiency and reduction of waste.
  E-Inks are generally sourced from Taiwan from companies such as E-Ink Holdings.
  These suppliers generally also focus on sustainability.

- **Sustainability**: LCDs have established separation streams that make for easier recycling.
  E-Ink panels are easier to recycle and have significantly longer life spans relative to LCDs.
  Both are significantly more energy-efficient and sustainable than OLED displays.

### Device External Structure {.unnumbered .unlisted}

- **Objects**: A blend of recycled polymers and bio-based sugarcane renewable source

- **Sourcing**: They are generally sourced from Malaysia and Indonesia, which specialize in recycled plastics and exercise  ISO 14021 audits and similar standards to verify their recycled content and eco-friendly production processes.

- **Sustainability**: The plastic blend would require less energy and is engineered for easier recyclability.

### Device Internal Structure {.unnumbered .unlisted}

- **Objects**:Recycled Aluminum

- **Sourcing**: Generally sourced from certified European or American Recycling plants.

- **Sustainability**: Reprocessing recycled Aluminum requires about 5% of the energy expenditure of newly processed Aluminum.
  This process lowers embodied carbon as well

### Prints On Packaging and Printed Materials {.unnumbered .unlisted}

- **Objects**: Vegetable non-VOC Inks --- these Inks are made from renewable sources and contain minimal volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations.

- **Sourcing**: These are generally sourced from eco-friendly chemical suppliers in Europe. 

- **Sustainability**: Production requires fewer emissions and toxic waste and is easier to recycle. 

### Packaging {.unnumbered .unlisted}

- **Objects**: FSC-Certified Recycled Cardboard(Forest Stewardship Council) and Minimal Bio-Based Plastic Films.
  The Films are used for shrink wrapping in packaging.

- **Sourcing**: FSC-certified recycled Cardboard comes from European suppliers, and The Bio-Based Films are generally sourced from South East Asia, generally from Indonesia and Malaysia. 

- **Sustainability**: FSC-certified recycled Cardboard boasts a lower carbon footprint. Both require less energy expenditure and are easily recycled.
