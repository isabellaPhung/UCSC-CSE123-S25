## Third-Party Integration
Since many other popular applications use a similar system of entry keeping that our user could have already set up how they wanted, our server can retrieve data from these sites and parse them onto our device. Event entries that a standard calendar application would use must have the parameters present within our system to properly dictate an event, that being the start time, duration or ending time, and name. By establishing a proper tool chain for establishing a connection to the API of desired cloud based calendars and interpreting the entry data into our system, our user may connect any calendar account to our server, allowing for persistent gathering of event entries to be loaded onto our device. Tasks may also be imported into the system from these programs such as from Google Tasks, however since sites like these often lack the priority parameter, the default priority level must be set to an arbitrary value to be altered later by the user. This priority level should be low, as we would want to avoid providing any unnecessary offset to the user's work time without their authority.
