## Third-Party Integration
Since many other popular applications use a similar system of entry keeping that our user could have already set up how they wanted, our server can retrieve data from these sites and parse them onto our device. Event entries that a standard calendar application would use must have the parameters present within our system to properly dictate an event, that being the start time, duration or ending time, and name. By establishing a proper tool chain for establishing a connection to the API of desired and eligible cloud based calendars and interpreting the entry data into our system, we enable users to link their calendar accounts to our server and seamlessly import their events.
Tasks may also be imported into the system from these programs such as from Google Tasks, however since sites like these often lack the priority parameter, the default priority level must be set to a default value to be altered later by the user. Incoming tasks should be set to the lowest priority, which is without any offset, as we would want to avoid providing any unnecessary alterations to the user's work flow without their authority.
