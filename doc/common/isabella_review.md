Working on this project was a long and difficult process. As far as what went well, I'm incredibly grateful to my talented team members; in many ways it was my peers who I learned the most from as we worked hard together, bounced ideas, helped each other out, and troubleshooted issues together. I'm immensely proud of our resulting prototype, manufactured design, design document, and presentations.
Although the limitations of the hardware proved incredibly difficult to work with, I'm fairly satsified with the way the device turned out in the end, all things considered. Our choice of library, ESP-IDF saved us a lot of memory. The Arduino library is easier to develop for but tends to eat up more memory. 
As far as what could be improved, for sure I wish I could have spent more time on improving the device functionality rather than fighting the memory limitations of the device. During development, it was hard to determine exactly how much memory we would need for this sort of device and by the time we realized just how limited we were, we didn't have enough time to migrate over to a new system. We did go back and forth about possibly purchasing a ESP32-S3, but the base devkit we were looking at wasn't a significant improvement in memory, and we decided to focus on what we had on hand. I think it was this hardware choice that made finishing the prototype so slow unfortunately. If we had the chance to add in some more features, such as time blocking or touch functionality, I think the prototype would have felt much closer to the manufactured product.
