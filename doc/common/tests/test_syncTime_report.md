### Sync time test report
\noindent
**Test Purpose**:
This is intended to verify that the device is capable of synchronizing within 10 seconds as is described in our design objectives.

\noindent
**Test Procedure**:
Exact testing procedures can be found at \ref{sync_time_procedure}. Results are visually observed.

\noindent
**Test Results**:

- Device had existing user data on it from \ref{cloud_test} so test is begun from step 6
- After pressing the synch button on the prototype, timer was begun
- Timer was stopped once the loading screen was full cleared from the screen, taking 28s and 58ms.

\noindent
**Final Analysis**:
The device failed. It was not able to complete syncing within the alloted 10 seconds.
