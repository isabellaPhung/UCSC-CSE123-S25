### Tensile Strength testing
Introduction: In order to ensure the integrity of the plastic housing of the productivity device, the material must under go compressive pressure testing to verify its strength.

Scope: Housing material, strength test 

Apparatus: 6x productivity device plastic housing material samples, tensile testing apparatus, acrylic blast shield

Independent variables: Pressure applied

Dependent variables: Pressure before materials crack

Procedure:
1. Take pictures of all samples before beginning the test.
2. Safety glasses are required for this test. The following test was designed with a Mark-10 motorized tensile test stand in mind but can be adapted to other motorized tensile testers. Set up the tensile test machine based off of fig. [1](#fig:tensile){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:tensile"}. Ensure that the sample is firmly clamped to the base of the tensile testing machine. This set up is intended to apply pressure on the sample until it deforms past usability or cracks.

3. Put up the acrylic blast shield and ensure all persons are located behind it to reduce the possbility of injury from flying plastic pieces.
4. Ensure the device screen shows the maximum pressure from the start of the test. Begin lowering the pushing end of the tensile machine into the plastic piece, slowly applying more and more pressure until it cracks or deforms past the point of usability.
8. When the test is complete, raise the tensile testing arm, and remove the acrylic blast shield when safe to do so. Inspect and take pictures of all samples.

Expectation: Record the value of the maximum pressure the plastic housing endured. If testing chemically exposed materials, compare the values with non exposed samples.
