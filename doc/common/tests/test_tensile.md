### Tensile Strength testing
Introduction:  

Scope: Housing material, strength test 

Apparatus: 6x productivity device plastic housing material samples, tensile testing apparatus, acrylic blast shield

Independent variables: Pressure applied

Dependent variables: Pressure before materials crack

Procedure:
1. Take pictures of all samples before beginning the test.
2. Safety glasses are required for this test. The following test was designed with a Mark-10 motorized tensile test stand in mind but can be adapted to other motorized tensile testers. Set up the tensile test machine based off of fig. [1](#fig:drop){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:tensile"}. This set up is intended to apply pressure on the sample until it deforms past its original shape or cracks.

3. Put up the acrylic blast shield and ensure all persons are located behind it to reduce the possbility of injury from flying plastic pieces.
4. Ensure the device screen shows the maximum pressure from the start of the test. Begin lowering the pushing end of the tensile machine into the plastic piece, slowly applying more and more pressure until it cracks or deforms past the point of usability.
8. Inspect and take pictures of all samples.

Expectation: Plastic housing samples may show some deformation or weakness as a result of bleach or acetone, but should not show any damage from the remaining chemicals. Samples must undergo a tensile strength test and have their tensile strength results directly compared to a typical sample to verify their structural integrity.
