# UV Exposure Testing

Introduction: Electronic devices require rigorous testing to guarantee longevity and reliable performance throughout their operational lifespan. Ultraviolet radiation exposure represents a significant environmental hazard for portable tablet devices, particularly those used in outdoor applications or near windows where solar radiation can cause material degradation, display performance deterioration, and housing discoloration. The primary testing standard utilized for UV exposure evaluation is IEC 60068-2-5, which specifies comprehensive methods for testing electronic equipment under simulated solar radiation and accelerated weathering conditions. This standard is complemented by ASTM G154 for fluorescent UV lamp testing, ASTM G155 for xenon arc exposure simulation, and ISO 4892 series for international harmonization.

**Scope:** display performance, touch sensitivity, housing materials, optical properties

**Apparatus:** productivity device, UV chamber with fluorescent UV lamps (UVA-340 and UVB-313), xenon arc lamp chamber, UV radiometer, spectrophotometer, controlled environment chamber, host machine for testing

**Independent variables:** UV exposure type (UVA, UVB, full spectrum solar simulation), exposure duration (15 kWh/m2, 50 kWh/m2, 100 kWh/m2), irradiance level (0.89 W/m2/nm at 340nm), temperature during exposure (60 degrees C +/- 5 degrees C, 65 degrees C +/- 3 degrees C), humidity level (50% RH, 65% RH)

**Dependent variables:** Display brightness levels (cd/m2), color coordinates (CIE Lab*), luminance uniformity (%), touch sensitivity response time (ms), surface gloss retention (%), housing color change (Delta E), material degradation (visual inspection), optical transmittance (%)

## Procedure

1. Verify the device is fully charged and operational by powering on and checking all basic functions.

2. **IEC 60068-2-5 Baseline Testing:**
   - Record initial display brightness at maximum setting using calibrated photometer
   - Measure color accuracy using standard test patterns and spectrophotometer
   - Document surface gloss levels using 60 degree gloss meter
   - Test touch sensitivity across all screen areas and record response times

3. **ASTM G154 Fluorescent UV Accelerated Aging Testing (specific wavelength):**
   - Place device in UV chamber with UVA-340 lamps
   - Set irradiance to 0.89 W/m2/nm at 340nm wavelength
   - Maintain specimen temperature at 60 degrees C +/- 5 degrees C (standard specimen temperature)
   - Expose for cycles totaling 15 kWh/m2 UV dose
   - Monitor UV intensity continuously with calibrated radiometer

4. **ASTM G155 Xenon Arc Testing (full spectrum wavelength):**
   - Transfer device to xenon arc chamber for full spectrum solar simulation
   - Set irradiance to 0.55 W/m2 at 340nm with daylight filters
   - Maintain black panel temperature at 65 degrees C +/- 3 degrees C (black panel temperature)
   - Include moisture cycles: 102 minutes dry / 18 minutes water spray
   - Continue exposure to reach total of 50 kWh/m2

5. **Post-Exposure Evaluation:**
   - Allow device to stabilize at room temperature for 4 hours
   - Repeat all baseline measurements
   - Calculate retention percentages for all optical properties
   - Perform visual inspection for surface defects, crazing, or chalking
   - Test all device functions including wifi connectivity and data persistence

6. **Additional Assessments per Standards:**
   - Measure surface hardness change using pencil hardness test
   - Evaluate adhesion of coatings using tape test method
   - Document any delamination or blistering of screen protectors

## Expectation

After 65 kWh/m2 total UV exposure across multiple test methods, the device should maintain at least 85% of original display brightness, show color change (Delta E) less than 3.0, retain full touch sensitivity with response times within 10% of baseline, and exhibit no visible surface degradation or functional failures. Housing materials should show minimal discoloration and maintain structural integrity per IEC 60068-2-5 requirements.
