### Many Users to One Device \label{many_procedure}
Introduction: If, for example, two parents wanted to monitor their child's device, they would both need to access the data on one device. This test verifies the capability of editing and sending new tasks to the same device from two separate accounts.

Scope: flash storage, file operations, cloud operations

Apparatus: productivity device, laptop or mobile device for web app interaction

Independent variables: cloud data storage, flash storage

Dependent variables: File contents (database), power on behavior (planned)

Procedure:

1. Power on the device and verify it is connected to the internet by checking the wifi symbol in the top right. If the wifi symbol is not displayed, connect to the device's access point and provide it wifi credentials. If the test already has existing user information on it and is set up, skip to step 7.
2. Create a test user on the web app. 
3. Log into the user via a laptop or mobile device. 
4. Add the device to the user using the corresponding device ID.
5. Add a task, event, and habit to be written to the device. Change the time setting from 12 hour to 24 hour display. 
6. Check the device to verify that the new schedule data has been added and the settings have been changed.
7. Create a second test user on the web app. 
8. Log into the second user via a laptop or mobile device. 
9. Add the device to that user using the corresponding device ID.
10. The device dashboard should show the earlier tasks that were created from the first user account.
11. Add another set of tasks, events, and habits to be written to the device. Change the time setting from 24 hour to 12 hour display. 
12. Check the device to verify that the new schedule data has been added and the settings have been changed.

Expectation: Both users should be able to view and edit the same set of schedule information that is synchronized to the device.
