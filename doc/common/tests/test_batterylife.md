### Test Battery Life, Life Cycle and Charge Speed
Introduction: Device battery is one of the most essential components to test for everyday use. This entails charging and discharing functionality as well as multitudes of cycles of this process. . The testing protocol integrates three primary international standards: IEC 61960 establishes standardized procedures for cycle life testing and capacity retention measurements; IEC 62133-2 focuses on safety requirements including thermal performance, electrical abuse tolerance, and temperature-dependent behavior; and JEITA ET-4041 provides accelerated aging methodologies to predict long-term calendar life and capacity degradation. Together, these standards ensure battery systems meet safety requirements, deliver consistent performance across operational temperature ranges, and maintain adequate capacity throughout the expected service life of the device. 

Scope: battery capacity, charging performance, power management, thermal behavior

Apparatus: productivity device, battery analyzer, environmental chamber, programmable power supply, thermal imaging camera, multimeter, data logging equipment, host machine for testing

Independent variables: charge cycle count (100, 500, 1000, 1500 cycles), operating temperature (-10°C, 25°C, 45°C, 60°C), discharge rates (0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C), charge rates (0.5C, 1C, 2C), state of charge levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

Dependent variables: battery capacity retention (mAh, %), charge time to full (minutes), discharge time to cutoff (minutes), internal resistance (mΩ), peak operating temperature (°C), power efficiency (%), cycle life count, voltage stability (V), self-discharge rate (%/month)

-     Test 2C fast charging: thermal behavior and capacity impact
-     Measure charging efficiency (Wh in vs. Wh stored) for each rate
-     Document any capacity degradation from fast charging


7.  Post-Exposure Evaluation:
-     Allow device to stabilize at room temperature for 4 hours
-     Repeat all baseline measurements
-     Calculate retention percentages for all optical properties

-     Store batteries at 60°C ± 2°C at 50% SOC for 168 hours
-     Measure capacity loss after each storage condition
-     Test recovery performance after accelerated aging 

10. Calendar Life Assessment:

-     Store device at 25°C ± 2°C at 50% SOC for extended periods
-     Measure self-discharge rate monthly for 6 months
