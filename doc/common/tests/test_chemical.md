### Chemical testing
Introduction: Users may use household cleaning products on the surface of the device to sterilize or clean it of dust. These chemicals may weaken or damage the device housing. This test determines what chemicals the users must avoid use on the device. Material samples must be at least 3 inches by 3 inches.

Scope: chemical material testing 

Apparatus: 6x productivity device plastic housing material samples, 6x LCD screen protector samples

Independent variables: chemicals

Dependent variables: plastic housing integrity 

Procedure:

Chemicals:
- 99% Isopropyl Alchohol
- Acetone
- Clorox
- 409 cleaner
- Windex
- Bleach

1. Non porous disposable gloves, safety glasses, and mask of at least N99 rating or higher are required for this test to reduce fume inhalation and protect eyes from any chemical splashing. Prepare multiple cotton swabs on a sterile surface, there will have to be at least one swab per chemical tested. 
2. Take pictures of all samples before applying any chemicals to the surface.
3. Begin with saturating a cotton swab in one of the chemicals and apply a thin layer to the surface of a housing sample and a screen protector sample.
4. Set aside the samples in a room temperature area undisturbed where it is not exposed to significant sunlight.
5. Discard the cotton swab. Discard the gloves if they were exposed to the chemical and apply fresh gloves to prevent cross contamination.
6. Repeat for all chemicals and all samples.
7. Allow the samples to remain undisturbed for 72 hours from application before checking on them.
8. Inspect and take pictures of all samples.

Expectation: Samples may show some deformation or weakness as a result of bleach or acetone, but should not show any damage from the remaining chemicals. Housing material samples must undergo a tensile strength test and have their tensile strength results directly compared to a typical sample to verify their structural integrity.
