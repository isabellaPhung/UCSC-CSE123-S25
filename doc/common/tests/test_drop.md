### Drop testing
Introduction: Everyday lightweight devices face wear and tear. One of the common sources of damage being dropping the device. In order to replicate all the ways in which the productivity device can be damaged, drop testing is performed to ensure the device remains functional after damage.

Scope: device structural integrity

Apparatus: productivity device, host machine for functionality tests, measuring tape, adjustable height desk

Independent variables: device integrity, full device functionality

Dependent variables: drop height, device drop orientation

Procedure:

1.  Verify productivity device is unplugged. Clear a space to perform
    the drop test and ensure all test participants are wearing close
    toed shoes. Flooring should be hard such as concrete, linoleum, or
    hardwood, avoid carpeted spaces for this test.

2.  Using the measuring tape, measure a height from the ground up to 100
    centimeters as is compliant with IEC drop testing standards. Adjust
    the adjustable height desk such that the top edge is at 100
    centimeters.

3.  The device will be dropped four times off the edge of the desk, each
    with specific orientations, intended to emulate the possible ways in
    which the device could fall or be dropped. The device should be slid
    towards the edge of the desk in the orientations shown in Fig.
    [\[fig:desk\_drop\]](#fig:desk_drop){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:desk_drop"}. Pictures should be taken of the device
    at all angles to document the progressive damage and a functionality
    test must be performed after each drop.

4.  The device will be dropped once more, this time by having the tester
    hold the device facing themselves 100 centimeters above the ground
    and letting go of the device as shown in Fig.
    [1](#fig:drop){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:drop"}. Once
    again, images should be taken of the device and a functionality test
    must be performed after the drop.

Expectation: No cracking on the LCD screen and device remains fully
functional after all five drops. Minor defects on the plastic housing
are expected, but damage should be minimal without large cracks in the
plastic.
