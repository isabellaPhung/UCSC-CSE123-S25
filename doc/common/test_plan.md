Firstly tests should be made to ensure the device preforms as needed. To ensure the software functions correctly test benches for data entry and database updates should be developed. Then when applying this software to the device, two essential factors should be ensured, web connectivity, and data persistence. Web connectivity can be tested through a simple ping test, ensuring that a device can send a signal through the server and to the device. Data persistence would include turning the device off, and disconnecting power and ensuring that data is retained when the device is reactivated.

Qualitative analysis can then be made on user input to determine if the device can positively affect productivity. The device would be provided the device and have it placed on their workspace for a period of time, afterwards they would be given a feedback forum where they determine how much the device improved their workflow.
