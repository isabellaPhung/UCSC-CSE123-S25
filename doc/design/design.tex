\subsection{Additional Requirements}
Each device will be shipped with a unique serial number (ID) and an 8-digit code for device identification.
Alongside the device, a printed start up manual must be included with the device. An example is shown below:

\input{build/startManual_md}
Additional specifications for the manufactured design are described in section \ref{improvements} and section \ref{final_specs}.

\subsection{Feasibility of Design} \label{final_specs}
After running through multiple tests using the prototype device, the manufactured design was demonstrated to be a practical product. Wifi and server connection as well as basic device functionality were shown to work. With device processor and memory improvements, additional features will be added to further expand the productivity device's capabilities.
Referencing our initial \ref{design_obj}{design objectives}, we revised the specifications of the manufactured design as shown in the table below.
