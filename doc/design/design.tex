\subsection{Additional Requirements}
Each device will be shipped with a unique serial number and an 8-digit code for device identification.
Alongside the device, a printed start up manual must be included with the device. An example is shown below:

\subsection{Feasibility of Design}%explicitly lay out if this design works
% TODO: discuss the feasibility of the design
% I think it makes sense to reference the original decision table and show the finalized specs
After running through multiple tests using the prototype device, the manufactured design was demonstrated to be a practical product. Wifi and server connection as well as basic device functionality were shown to work. With device processor and memory improvements, additional features will be added to further expand the productivity device's capabilities.
Referencing our initial \hyperref{design_obj}, we revised the specifications of the manufactured design as shown in the table below.
