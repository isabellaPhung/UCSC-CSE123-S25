## Hardware

The prototype consists of the microcontroller dev-board, an LCD touch screen breakout board, a real-time clock breakout board, and several buttons.

- **ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-1**: A microcontroller board featuring the ESP32-C3 SoC.
- **MSP3520**: An inexpensive, SPI TFT LCD touch screen that comes with an SD card reader.
- **Adafruit 3295**: A breakout board for the PCF8523 real time clock.

The wiring diagram is described by Figure \ref{proto_schem}

%% From the demo procedure, it seems more fitting here FIXME
%% ESP32 would be replaced with Custom microcontroller PCB.
%% The Esp32 must be replaced for the Manufactured product with a costum microcontroller or PCB so that the product is designed with optimzed size, power consumtion and physical design.
