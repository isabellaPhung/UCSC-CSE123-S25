The prototype currently does not do much other then show the latest publish on the LCD.
The following needs to be added to the prototype to get closer to representing the final product:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Better organization for cross-task communication. The current design dedicates only a buffer with a semaphore.
  \item Implement the planning algorithm and have it pull new tasks from the MQTT task
  \item Find and implement drivers for various peripherals.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Real time clock
    \item Speaker + amplifier + DAC
    \item Haptic motor
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Create a better user experience and GUI screens
  \item Implement a low-power sleep mode
  \item Create a more in-depth mockup of the final design.
\end{itemize}
